## Technologies

* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* React
* Postgres
* Express
* React-Boostrap

## User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to see my whole 'Closet' in the app
* As a user, I want to be able to filter out specific clothing pieces
* As a user, I would like to be able to change the status of clothing pieces (in closet, in laundry(if not in either, say it's missing))
* As a user, I would like an easy form to add new stuff to my Closet

## MVP
* Display the inventory of clothing
* Filter out types of clothing in the seacrh page
* Allow users to create, read, update, and destroy their clothing
* Make it so users cannot see any urls except the welcome page if not logged in

## Stretch Goals
show the status of each individual clothing (stored, used, washing)
* provide an up to standard view and styling
* show that an outfit is avaliable if all clothes are avaliable
* allow your outfit to be reserved on a day
* allow users to create an outfit using items of their current storage
* Schedule either specific clothing pieces or outfits
* Favorite clothing pieces
* Favorite outfits
* Scroll through 'Favorite outfits' page and be able to see if outfit is available for use   

## Post-Project
I'll say it once and I'll say it again, Projects are probably our favorite things about the cohort. Something about applying all we've learned during the unit and working with it everyday to complete a project definitely helps in connecting the dots and making sense of everything. Our plans post-cohort were similar in terms of we know we wanted to work as fullstack developers and so this project we wanted to get more time/practice in working with both react and a database(in this case, postgres). To end it off, we can proudly say we feel stronger working in fullstack projects.
